                    The Vex robotics competition is a competition where students
                    put their robots to compete. Solutions are innovated to
                    solve challenges present in the competition and gain as many
                    points as possible. In vex robotics competition, students
                    may partake in skills or alliance challenges. In skills,
                    robots are put against the clock to score as many points as
                    possible. In alliance, students must ally with another team,
                    compete in a 2v2 match, and gain as many points as possible.

                The vex experience was unique to me. Due to covid, most of my
                seniors who had experience in this competition had graduated, so
                I had to start from scratch. On top of that, my team was formed
                in late November and was six months behind most teams. Despite
                that, my team managed to get the top 16th in the alliance match
                in Singapore. Considering that we essentially had no experience,
                it was quite an achievement.
                <br />
                <br />
                Through the competition, I learnt many new things and got to
                experiment and innovate new solutions. Despite not winning the
                qualifying for worlds, as the competition progressed, many of
                the top teams started to use assets similar to our robot design.
                This includes a flexible funnel and a flush intake.

                      (FLL) or First Lego League is a lego based competition.
                      Students are required to complete missions within a
                      2-minute and 30 seconds timer to score as many points as
                      possible. Students are also presented with problems to
                      solve and are required to present their innovation
                      projects to the judges through a presentation.

                      <br />

                      I have partaken in 2 FLL competitions and have had many
                      memorable experiences. The first competition I
                      participated in would be FLL replay. In this particular
                      competition, I took up the role of both a builder and
                      coder. At the start, we tried replicating a design we had
                      planned to use for (NRC) regular for our robot chassis. We
                      then learnt that the demands of the missions were vastly
                      different and focused more on efficiency over speed. We
                      changed our overall robot chassis to one similar to our
                      seniors. This experience taught us the reputation of
                      having a modular and quickly produced attachment bay.
                      Through interactions with seniors and practice, I became
                      better at building structurally stable pieces. I adapted
                      my building style to make it more convenient for my
                      teammates and me to code.

                We also learnt how to use differentiation in PID to line trace
                and explored how a gyro sensor works. We realised that most of
                our gyro sensors were broken and started to drift, making this
                unreliable. This potential was later discussed and experimented
                with the new spike sets and would be later used by another team
                the following year.

                Though I did not win any awards, I learnt and explored many
                valuable pieces of knowledge that I will always appreciate.

                The following year, I participated in FLL cargo connect. That
                year, I tried forming a team with new teammates. I explored new
                strategies and refined my building technique. I started being
                able to identify exploits to score more points than intended and
                shared ideas about passive systems. One example would be the
                image on the right, where the robot would push a detachable
                passive attachment to complete multiple missions. This allows
                the robot to save motor ports for much more complicated tasks.

                <br />
                <br />

                I made the mistake of prioritising my juniors over my team. This
                led to sacrificing my team's recording and practice time, which
                resulted in us being unable to score to our full capability.
