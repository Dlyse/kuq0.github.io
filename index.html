                Vex robotics competition is a competition where students put
                their robots to compete. Solutions are innovated to solve
                challenges present in the competition and gain as many points as
                possible. In vex robotics competition, students may partake in
                skills or alliance challenges. In skills, robots are put against
                the clock to score as many points as possible. In alliance,
                students must ally with another team, compete in a 2v2 match,
                and gain as many points as possible.

              The vex experience was unique to me. Due to covid, most of my
              seniors who had experience in this competition had graduated, so I
              had to start from scratch. On top of that, my team was formed in
              late November and was six months behind most teams. Despite that,
              my team managed to get the top 16th in the alliance match in
              Singapore. Considering that we essentially had no experience, it
              was quite an achievement.
              <br />
              <br />
              Through the competition, I learnt many new things and got to
              experiment and innovate new solutions. Despite not winning the
              qualifying for worlds, as the competition progressed, many of the
              top teams started to use assets similar to our robot design. This
              includes a flexible funnel and a flush intake.

                  (FLL) or First Lego League is a lego based competition.
                  Students are required to complete missions within a 2-minute
                  and 30 seconds timer to score as many points as possible.
                  Students are also presented with problems to solve and are
                  required to present their innovation projects to the judges
                  through a presentation.

                  <br />

                  I have partaken in 2 FLL competitions and have had many
                  memorable experiences. The first competition I participated in
                  would be FLL replay. In this particular competition, I took up
                  the role of both a builder and coder. At the start, we tried
                  replicating a design we had planned to use for (NRC) regular
                  for our robot chassis. We then learnt that the demands of the
                  missions were vastly different and focused more on efficiency
                  over speed. We changed our overall robot chassis to one
                  similar to our seniors. This experience taught us the
                  reputation of having a modular and quickly produced attachment
                  bay. Through interactions with seniors and practice, I became
                  better at building structurally stable pieces. I adapted my
                  building style to make it more convenient for my teammates and
                  me to code.

              We also learnt how to use differentiation in PID to line trace and
              explored how a gyro sensor works. We realised that most of our
              gyro sensors were broken and started to drift, making this
              unreliable. This potential was later discussed and experimented
              with the new spike sets and would be later used by another team
              the following year.

              Though I did not win any awards, I learnt and explored many
              valuable pieces of knowledge that I will always appreciate.

              The following year, I participated in FLL cargo connect. That
              year, I tried forming a team with new teammates. I explored new
              strategies and refined my building technique. I started being able
              to identify exploits to score more points than intended and shared
              ideas about passive systems. One example would be the image on the
              right, where the robot would push a detachable passive attachment
              to complete multiple missions. This allows the robot to save motor
              ports for much more complicated tasks.

              I made the mistake of prioritising my juniors over my team. This
              led to sacrificing my team's recording and practice time, which
              resulted in us being unable to score to our full capability.

              I also tried building a stable and modular chassis for the spike
              set and came up with this design. The size of the spike
              electronics was different, which caused awkward space management
              of the robot. I mainly focused on the structural stability of the
              robot, as shown in how I connected the electronics. I was not
              satisfied with the finishing of the robot, as my teammate building
              the exterior prioritised aesthetics over structural stability.
              Nevertheless, the robot did its job, and I was alright with it. I
              also made a replica of the robot where my team could test our
              attachment interactions while others could focus coding on the
              robot.

              Apart from that, I experimented with building an autonomous
              chassis powered by rubber bands and or gravity. This allowed my
              team to do multiple operations at once within the 2 minutes and 30
              seconds timmer, allowing us to score more points.

              <br />
              At the end of the day, I decided to drop out of the competition as
              I realised I was no longer having fun. Even though I did not
              participate in this competition, I shared my thoughts and advice
              with my juniors. I taught them building techniques, how the
              self-power chassis, routing and exploits. I also encouraged them
              to try new things, such as gyro tracing and PID.

              Through the event, I got to visit Nuspace to learn the use of cube
              satellites. I also visited satellite dishes on the NUS campus and
              learned how they operate such devices. Furthermore, we had
              meetings with various professors and NASA engineers from overseas
              to discuss and learn about the uses of radio waves in space. I
              also got the opportunity to build an antenna, as shown in the
              image above. My group decided to take on the challenge, and we
              constructed an antenna that could receive waves emitted by the
              sun. This could be used to detect solar flares and solar eclipses.
              Although the antenna proportions were not accurate, due to how
              much leeway antennas have, we could still read wavelengths that
              came from the sun.

              <br />
              <br />

              Overall, I found this experience fascinating, primarily how people
              use waves to analyse stars. It has also further piqued my interest
              in satellites, notably the modular, cost efficiency and uses of
              cube satellites.

                  Balloon satellite is a program offered to sst students in the

                  balloon/balloon satellite into the sky to record data to
                  analyse. We were guided and taught by Nuspace about the

                  My team decided to build a satellite that had a shape of a D12

                  to create the D12, as the other material provided to us,
                  polycarbonate, was not precisely laser-cut friendly (chlorine
                  gas is formed during the process :D). Bound with nylon threads
                  and hot glue, the D12 was extremely sturdy, surviving many

                Through the Audrino uno, we planned to use the Xbee to receive
                data wirelessly from our humidity, temperature, velocity and
                gyro sensor. We also had plans to put a mobile phone into the
                D12 to record higher-definition videos.
                <br />
                <br />
                However, on the day itself, the previously suggested weight
                limit, 1kg, was, in fact, wrong. Furthermore, since our Xbee
                decided to fry itself on the flight date, we had to replace it,
                which required time. We were shifted to be the last group to fly
                our satellite. This meant we would fly our satellite with less
                air in the weather balloon. With that, our D12 structure and
                mobile phone were too heavy to fly. On top of that, there were
                thunderclouds nearby, and we could not fly the weather balloon
                in the open, opting to fly it in the indoor sports hall in the
                school. We decided to fly our satellite with barebone
                electronics and a mini wireless camera. This allowed us to
                capture some video evidence of the flight. We also added an SD
                card to the overall setup; if something were to go wrong, we
                still had data stored somewhere safely. With the data, we were
                able to plot a pressure altitude graph and conclude one of the
                few hypothesis we had at the start of the experiment.
                <br />
                <br />
                The overall experience was quite fun, and I enjoyed myself. I
                learned more about satellite orbit and realised that I was
                interested in flywheels used to rotate and position satellites.
                Overall, This event piqued my interest in satellite
                construction, be it used in space or in weather balloons, and
                has allowed me to explore potential job opportunities that I
                have never thought of.

              modelling vex chassis desgines that my juniors could learn from.
