                        The Vex robotics competition is where students put their robots to compete. Solutions are innovated to solve challenges present in the competition and gain as many points as possible. In vex robotics competition, students may partake in skills or alliance challenges. In skills, robots are put against the clock to score as many points as possible. In alliance, students must ally with another team, compete in a 2v2 match, and gain as many points as possible.

                The vex experience was unique to me. Due to covid, most of my seniors who had experience in this competition had graduated, so I had to start from scratch. On top of that, my team was formed in late November and was six months behind most teams. Despite that, my team managed to get the top 16th in the alliance match in Singapore. Considering that we essentially had no experience, it was quite an achievement.

                Through the competition, I learnt many new things and got to experiment and innovate new solutions. Despite not winning the qualifying for worlds, as the competition progressed, many of the top teams started to use assets similar to our robot design. This includes a flexible funnel and a flush intake.
